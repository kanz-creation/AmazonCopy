# AmazonCopy

Created via REACT JS 

Project focused on implementing React Context Api. This allowed me to successfully create global variables, which in this case was my shopping cart items. The shopping cart items can be added/removed and the total subtotal is updated dynamically. 

For images of the working app, please refer to the pdf attached.
